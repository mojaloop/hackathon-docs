## Tools:

This sandbox includes the following tools:

- [Sandbox Dev Hub](http://beta.moja-lab.live/home/0-getting-started)
- [Mojaloop Testing Toolkits](#testing-toolkit)
- [Simulator UI](http://simulator-ui.beta.moja-lab.live) - for more information on using the simulator-ui, refer to [todo this external guide]()

### Testing Toolkit

The [Mojaloop Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/mojaloop/ml-testing-toolkit) is a tool for testing your DFSP's implementation. It also helps you get up and running and 

We currently have 2 DFSPs hooked up to the testing toolkit: `figmm` and `eggmm`

See:
- [figmm - monitoring](http://figmm-ttk.beta.moja-lab.live/admin/monitoring) to monitor live requests and callbacks
- [figmm - send requests](http://figmm-ttk.beta.moja-lab.live/admin/outbound_request) to make live requests _from_ `figmm` to other DFSPs on the network
- [eggmm - monitoring](http://eggmm-ttk.beta.moja-lab.live/admin/monitoring) to monitor live requests and callbacks
- [eggmm - send requests](http://eggmm-ttk.beta.moja-lab.live/admin/outbound_request) to make live requests _from_ `eggmm` to other DFSPs on the network
  > Hint: Click "Load Sample" to look through the sample test cases available and load one


Check out the [Testing Toolkit P2P Guide](/3-guides/5_ttk_p2p/) to use the testing to send a peer to peer transfer.

### MIFOS Payment Hub

This lab is soon to be connected with the MIFOS Payment Hub, which will demonstrate the MIFOS and Mojaloop ecosystems working together, and let you test out a whole bunch of DFSP-based features.

**Check back soon for more information about the Mojaloop OSS Lab + MIFOS Payment Hub**

<!-- ### Payment Manager

> Note: Payment Manager support in the sandbox is still in _beta_, and the dfsps here are not yet connected to the other DFSPs in the sandbox. We're working on it!
