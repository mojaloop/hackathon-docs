# Getting Started

Now that your Mojaloop Sandbox is up and running, here's what you can do next:

1. [Read through the overview section](/1-overview/), and get a feel for what this Sandbox offers
1. [Play with the Mojaloop Demos](/99-demos/)
1. [Take the DFSP Onboarding Tutorial](/3-guides/1_dfsp_setup/)
1. [Explore the Different APIs](/1-overview/#apis) Mojaloop Offers
1. [Read the Mojaloop Documentation](https://docs.mojaloop.io/documentation/)

<!-- This is where it all begins...

You can write anything in here.

- Maybe a quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.
- Maybe what is needed to set up the dev environment.
- Maybe a contributing guide.
