# Getting Started

Now that your Mojaloop Sandbox is up and running, here's what you can do next:

1. [Play with the Mojaloop Demos](/99-demos/)
2. [Get your Access Token](/3-guides/1-dfsp-setup) so you can start talking to the sandbox
3. [Take the DFSP Onboarding Tutorial](/3-guides/1-dfsp-setup) 
4. [Explore the Different APIs](1-overview/#apis) Mojaloop Offers

This is where it all begins...

You can write anything in here.

- Maybe a quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.
- Maybe what is needed to set up the dev environment.
- Maybe a contributing guide.
